% this file should describe your design and implementation of the formula program. 

% In particular, it should detail your design, any design/implementation chal- lenges that you ran into, 
\section{Implementation}

My implementation is a big switch statement on over operation.

Based on that, it parses out the arguments and fetches and executes accordingly.

\section{Challenges}

This program was undoutedly the hardest programming assignment I have ever worked on.

The wide range of possible input made test cases difficult.

The C programming language is very bad a String manipulation, yet a lot of String manipulation was necessary.

The scattered documentation made clear answers to precise questions difficult to come by.

It was rewarding in the most frustrating way.

\section{Big-O Analysis}

\subsection{Space}

It uses exactly the amount of space that an actual Y86 implementation would!
Every byte is stored as a byte and manually split and combined to form meaningful information.

\subsection{Time}

It is completely linear based on input.
